# Simple REST Api Server
- Node.js
- Express
- Sequelize
- PostgreSQL

To run a server application you must have a **database** running.
In my case it is PostgreSQL but you can use any other dialect.
After the database is up, write in the console

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`

The server will start on port 5000 by default. 
Use Postman for requests
